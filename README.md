# KrazyRacer
A simple endless (well, not really endless to be honest) game, where you drive as a white car, and you must not touch the other cars at all. 
The longer you survive, the more points you will got (maxed at 1000 points at max level).

This program was built with Visual Studio 2017 Community, with .NET Framework.
Image sprites are from "SNES Top Gear", while the background music was a remaster from "SNES Top Gear Track 1".

Take a peek at the "Krazy Racer" folder, for the project's source code.
If you want to test the result only, simply run the .exe file inside the "0. Output" folder, and have fun :)
