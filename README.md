# KrazyRacer
A very first "Windows Form App Game" based on C# programming language that I made.

This program was built with Visual Studio 2017 Community, with .NET Framework.

Take a peek at the "Krazy Racer" folder, for the project's source code.
If you want to test the result only, simply download the "0. Output" folder.
Inside the folder, run the .exe file, and have fun :)
